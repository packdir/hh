# Difference

The grid layout is a two-dimensional system, allowing for the control of both columns and rows, while flex is a one-dimensional system that primarily focuses on controlling the layout along a single axis (either horizontal or vertical). Besides that, grid layouts can handle overlapping elements more effectively, whereas flex layouts are better suited for distributing space along a single axis.


# 在 Tailwind 中使用 grid

容器定义了三栏两行的例子：

    <div class="grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-2">
      ...
    </div>

Responsive:

    <div class="grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-2 md:grid-cols-12">
