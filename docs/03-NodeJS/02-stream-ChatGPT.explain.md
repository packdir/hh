Here are a few ways to pipe one stream to multiple streams in Node.js:

## pipe()

Using the pipe() function: The pipe() function is a built-in function in Node.js that allows you to pipe one stream to another. The syntax for using the pipe() function is:

    readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

For example, the following code will pipe the contents of a file to a new file:

    const fs = require('fs');

    const readFileStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
    const writeFileStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

    readFileStream.pipe(writeFileStream);

## PassThrough

Using a PassThrough stream: A PassThrough stream is a special type of stream that can be used to pipe data from one stream to another without modifying the data. The syntax for creating a PassThrough stream is:

    const { PassThrough } = require('stream');

    const passThroughStream = new PassThrough();

For example, the following code will pipe the contents of a file to a new file, and then pipe the contents of the new file to a third file:

    const fs = require('fs');
    const { PassThrough } = require('stream');

    const readFileStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
    const writeFileStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
    const passThroughStream = new PassThrough();

    readFileStream.pipe(passThroughStream);
    passThroughStream.pipe(writeFileStream);

## duplex

Using a duplex stream: A duplex stream is a stream that can be used to both read and write data. The syntax for creating a duplex stream is:

    const { Duplex } = require('stream');

    const duplexStream = new Duplex();

For example, the following code will create a duplex stream that can be used to both read and write data:

    const { Duplex } = require('stream');

    const duplexStream = new Duplex();

    duplexStream.on('readable', () => {
      const data = duplexStream.read();
      console.log(data);
    });

    duplexStream.on('writeable', () => {
      duplexStream.write('Hello, world!');
    });

Once you have created a duplex stream, you can use it to pipe data from one stream to another. For example, the following code will pipe the contents of a file to a new file, and then pipe the contents of the new file to a third file:

    const fs = require('fs');
    const { Duplex } = require('stream');

    const readFileStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
    const writeFileStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
    const duplexStream = new Duplex();

    duplexStream.on('readable', () => {
      const data = duplexStream.read();
      writeFileStream.write(data);
    });

    duplexStream.on('writeable', () => {
      readFileStream.pipe(duplexStream);
    });
